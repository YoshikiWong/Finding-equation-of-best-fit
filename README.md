Data Visualization and Linear Regression from Scratch

This repository demonstrates how to perform linear regression from scratch using basic Python and math, without relying on any external libraries for calculations. The final visualization is done using Matplotlib.

Overview

In this project, you'll learn how to calculate the equation of the best fit line for a set of data points using basic Python and mathematical concepts. We'll then plot the data points and the best fit line using Matplotlib.
